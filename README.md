## Watermark Information

To add the watermark "@codeash.007" as a website footer badge (HTML/CSS), you can include the following code snippet in the `<footer>` section of your HTML file (or a relevant CSS file for styling):

```html
<footer style="text-align: center; padding: 20px; background-color: #f0f0f0; color: #555;">
    <p style="margin: 0;">Â© <span style="font-weight: bold;">@codeash.007</span></p>
</footer>
```

This will create a simple footer with the watermark. You can customize the `style` attributes to match your website's design.
